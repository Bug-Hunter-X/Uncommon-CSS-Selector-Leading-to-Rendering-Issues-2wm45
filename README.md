This repository demonstrates a bug caused by an unusually complex CSS selector that leads to inconsistent rendering across different browsers. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a more straightforward and maintainable alternative.  The bug is characterized by unexpected behavior or failure to render as intended due to the complexity of the selector. The solution simplifies the CSS to ensure consistent and predictable results.
