The CSS code uses a very uncommon selector that combines multiple pseudo-classes and attributes in a complex way, leading to unexpected behavior or rendering issues in different browsers.  For example: `a[href*="example"]::before:hover { content: "Hello"; }` This selector is valid but might not work consistently across browsers and is hard to debug.
